libsysperf (0.2.4), 9th Dec 2011:
  * Fix use of non-standard/non-safe GCC nested functions extension
    ("auto" keyword).
  * Fix sp_smaps_filter memory leak in kernel thread removal code.
  * Rename the obsolete changelog auto-generated from source comments
    to changelog.old as sources are now maintained in version control.

libsysperf (0.2.2), 13 Jan 2010:
  * Relax version mismatch check.

libsysperf (0.2.1), 4 Mar 2009:
  * Various issues reported by Coverity have been fixed.

libsysperf (0.2.0), 13 May 2008:
  * As jhash.h is no longer included in linux-kernel-headers, a copy has
    been explicitly added to this package (its license is loose enough
    to permit this).
